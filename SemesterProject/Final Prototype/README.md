For a class assignment I was tasked with creating an educational game. I was also taking a beginning guitar class. So I created Fretboard Frenzy to help students learn to recognize notes on the staff. This project did not come without its challenges. I'd like to thank Randy Wimer, my guitar teacher, for allowing me to use the diagrams and images published in his book, Learn to Play Guitar in 117 Days. You can find the book at: https://wimerguitar.com/free-stuff

An Important Note: The High Score feature does not work at the github hosted link.
If you are familiar with unity, feel free to download the files from github and run the project via build and run on you local machine.

Enjoy!!
